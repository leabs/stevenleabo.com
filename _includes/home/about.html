      <p>
        I've been doing Frontend Web Development professionally for
        <span id="years"></span> years. I work with anyone from start-ups to
        larger companies. My strengths are styling, building layouts and
        components from designs, and being a team player! I love helping people
        reach their goals. Get in touch if you think I can help your business.
