Someone forked [a repo](https://github.com/leabs/jekyll-product-table) I set up and checking out what they did with my code was such a thrill!

The repo injects the frontmatter of markdown files into a searchable and sortable table (using the DataTables plugin). I pulled his code and built the project and discovered hundreds of items in rows of the table.

Further more, it appears the user’s items were from a .csv file, so they actually had a small python script that extracted the data from the .csv and generated the markdown files using python.

Feels great. I hope I made that person’s life a bit easier by setting up the general layout and structure.

Open source is awesome.
