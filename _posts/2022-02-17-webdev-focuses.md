For me, starting my journey with web development was somewhat stressful. I think people (myself included) often feel as if they need to create the next big thing to leave their mark on a space. The reality is the most beneficial knowledge in web development is utilizing what has already been created.

No one person that I know of has the skill set to design a killer app, develop it, market it, support it, all from scratch. There are rare exceptions, but the reality is knowing the skill set of one specific niche area is better than being OK at many.

For **front end web development** I would argue that knowing the following skills are paramount to having a successful career:

- **Foundational knowledge**: This can include understanding version control, and how to use it. HTML / CSS / JS regardless of if you’re using a framework. Knowing how data fetching works, and structuring that data on the webpage.
- **How to read Docs!** This one is big, but being able to sift through documentation is a great skill to have. A lot of my time is spent interpreting code and explanations from documentation.
- **Willingness to find open source or paid solutions**: I think acknowledging that there is a vast space of open source / paid code available to use in code repositories, and not trying to reinvent the wheel is a huge benefit. The more time you can spend building what you want while standing on the shoulders of giants, the more successful you will be.
- **Leveraging assets** (related to the above point) like web site templates, icon packs, and illustrations will not only save you time but make your work look more professional.
- **Being able to communicate well** with your team or client is important. Soft skills like this are hard to teach but you can work on them if you don’t yet have them. Over communicating is usually pretty hard to do, so you need to be able to reach out with questions or feedback.
- **Realizing that coding for 12 hours a day isn’t sustainable** and will lead to burn out, so maybe take a walk and relax a bit between coding sessions.
- **Have fun** because if you’re not having fun and learning, you will want to do something else eventually.

When I was in college studying web development I wish I read through a list like this, instead of discovering these points myself over the course of years, but I’m happy I got to where I am regardless. I hope this information is helpful to someone!
