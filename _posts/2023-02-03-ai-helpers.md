Right now as I type this, artificial intelligence is helping me. I am using a tool called GitHub Copilot to write this blog post. It is a new feature that uses machine learning to write code for you. It is still in beta, but it is already helping me write code faster and more accurately.

An example of how I use this would be something like this:

```html
<!--list all required head content for a website-->
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>My Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
```

It saves the time of typing out the boilerplate code for a website. It also helps me write code faster because I don't have to think about the syntax. I can just type what I want and it will write it for me. It is also helping me write code more accurately because it is writing the code for me. I don't have to worry about typos or syntax errors.

This helps low to mid level developers substantially, bringing them closer to a senior dev assuming they can understand foundational concepts, and will also help other occupations in the future. It will help doctors write prescriptions, lawyers write contracts, and even help teachers write lesson plans. It will also help with things like writing emails and writing reports. 

I'm in the unique position of being able to use this tool right now, and I'm excited to see how it will help me in the future. I'm also excited to see how it will help other occupations and education.
