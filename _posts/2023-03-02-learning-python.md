I've decided I want to do more coding outside of Web Development for fun. I'm the type of person that will set up yearly goals and generally I will follow through. Python has great support with docs and packages, and is mature enough to get a lot done with.

I started building a repo of random terminal apps called <a href="https://github.com/leabs/misc-python-apps" class="text-underline">misc-python-apps</a>. So far I've built a password generator, CSV to JSON formatter, and a few other cool apps. I plan on building more, and I'm excited to see what I can do with Python. Also, I started going over coding basics with my daughter using a repo called <a href="https://github.com/LilyLeabo/python-fundamentals" class="text-underline">python-fundamentals</a>, which is helping her understand concepts like variables, functions, and loops.
