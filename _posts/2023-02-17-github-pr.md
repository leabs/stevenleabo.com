I was browsing GitHub docs for something and noticed a header link (which was recently updated) was broken. This was strange because they do have GitHub actions in place to test out links. I forked the code repo for their official docs, fixed the link, and submitted a pull request. It was merged in a few hours. I'm excited to see my name in the contributors list!

Even though my commit was tiny, it feels good to contribute to a project, especially one on the scale of GitHub. Old me might've moved along, or maybe submitted a ticket, but I took the time to fix it myself. 

If you know me, you know I love coding static sites and documentation sites. It's a weird niche, but I love it. They inform developers, they're easy to build and maintain, and they're fast. The repo itself had the markdown files, so there isn't much of a backend to speak of. It also used CI with GitHub actions with a bunch of tests, which was cool to see. Forking and building a big project like that locally and not being overwhelmed felt great.
